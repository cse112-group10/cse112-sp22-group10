These delicious tacos are bursting with flavor and texture and are made in under 30 minutes with just a few fresh ingredients.\nCarne Asada (Aka steak) tacos were our go-to meal while living in Philadelphia. We purchased them from a popular Mexican taco stand on the busy market street in south Philly and ever since tasting them, I couldn\u2019t forget how simple yet flavor-packed they were. After years of perfecting the recipe, we\u2019ve come to realize that authentic Mexican tacos should not be complicated. The 4 main elements of a delicious taco grilled meat, salsa, warm tortillas, and a drizzle of lime. Anything beyond that is optional.",

   "To Prepare and Brine the Chicken: Using a chef's knife, break the chicken down into 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, and 2 wings and divide each breast half in half (making 4 breast pieces in total); leave all pieces bone-in. Split backbone crosswise into 2 pieces and reserve the neck if you choose to fry it as well.",
   "In a large lidded container or mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt. Add chicken to buttermilk brine, making sure it is fully coated and submerged; cover with lid or plastic wrap. Alternatively, you can place the brine and chicken in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag and place the bag in a dish to catch any leaks. Place in refrigerator and marinate overnight for at least 8 hours and no more than 12 hours.",
   "For Frying: Fill a 12-inch cast iron skillet with oil. (If using a skillet of a different size, increase or reduce the amount of oil to fill it halfway up.) Attach a clip-on thermometer and preheat the oil to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C), keeping the burner at medium-high heat. Line one sheet tray with paper towels and set a wire rack in another sheet tray.",
   "Whisk together the flour and salt. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of buttermilk brine into the flour and gently toss. Working with one piece of chicken at a time, lift chicken from buttermilk and immediately place it in flour with your \"wet\" hand. Using your other, \"dry\" hand, bury the chicken and press flour into all sides, packing tightly to form large clumps of flour coating each piece. Lift chicken out of flour and shake to remove any loose flour before placing into the hot oil. ",
   "Once the chicken is added to the oil, the temperature will drop to between 250 and 275\u00b0F (121 and 135\u00b0C). Do not increase the heat to compensate; just allow the oil temperature to gradually return to 325\u00b0F as the chicken cooks. The temperature should be up to 300\u00b0F after 10 minutes; if not, increase the heat. Fry, turning, until deeply golden brown all over, with extra-dark bits where the chicken makes contact with the pan.",
   "As each piece of chicken is ready, remove from oil to the paper towel\u2013lined sheet tray and season immediately with kosher salt. Transfer chicken to wire rack to rest.",
   "Meanwhile, for the Honey-Butter Drizzle: Add honey to a 1-quart saucepan and caramelize over medium-high heat until deep, nutty brown, with an aroma of burnt sugar. Remove from heat and add water. Return to heat and add butter, stirring until incorporated. Set aside.",
   "For the Spice Dust: Remove stems and seeds from chilies by cutting them open with kitchen shears over a wire rack set over a sheet tray. In a small saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat, toast chilies until fragrant, warm to the touch, and pliable. Set aside. In the same pan, toast star anise, cardamom, and cinnamon for 30 seconds before adding cumin and Sichuan peppercorns. Toast until fragrant and warm to the touch. In a spice grinder, grind toasted chilies and spices together until fine. Set aside.",
   "Just before serving, drizzle each piece of chicken with honey butter and generously sprinkle on spice dust. Serve with buttermilk waffles, if desired."

  "title": "Japanese Curry from Scratch",
  "id": "HWuT6n",
  "description": "Although they won\u2019t admit it, many restaurants also use packaged roux mixes to make their curry, the way they set their curry apart from others is through technique and the use of Kakushiaji. \n\nKakushiaji (\u96a0\u3057\u5473) literally means \u201chidden taste,\u201d and it\u2019s a cooking technique that involves adding a very small quantity of a contrasting ingredient to make subtle improvements to the taste of the dish. In the case of curry, this includes things like coffee, chocolate, vanilla, butter, chutney, fruit, etc.\n\nThe idea is to add just enough to make a subtle change, but not enough to be able to tell you\u2019ve added that ingredient. For this curry recipe, the kakushiaji ingredients include banana, soy sauce, and cocoa powder. The banana adds sweetness and a silky texture to the sauce, you want to use a ripe (yellow, but no brown speckles yet) banana. The soy sauce adds loads of umami, and the cocoa powder lends an earthy depth as well as a rich brown color. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve tried this recipe as written, I encourage you to experiment with different combinations of kakushiaji ingredients to come up with a curry that fits your ideal for a perfect Japanese Curry.

Everyone wants their chicken sandwich! They were so overwhelmed that they had to temporarily remove it from their menu. Of course, my chicken sandwich junkies came to me for my version. Naturally, I hopped to it to satisfy my spoiled Cookies!\n\nJuicy chicken is the foundation for the perfect Chicken Sandwich. Some like to pound of the breasts to make them thinner. I leave them as is. Thick and juicy breasts are key in my chicken sandwich! We like it spicy! So, I didn\u2019t spare the spice! My blend works every time! I love a good crunch in my sandwich! The key is to incorporate some of the wet brine into the dry flour mixture. It will create little pockets of crunch during the frying! To pack on the heat, I made a super easy and flavorful spicy mayo! It paired extremely well with our sandwich. I also add Gator Pickles. Google them!! They are absolutely delicious! They are spicy bread and butter pickles. Yes, a dream come true! Hopefully, my Spicy Chicken Sandwich will satiate the Chicken Sandwich craze for my Cookies! I worked hard to make sure every aspect complimented each other well. Don\u2019t divert from my recipe! If you can handle a little spice, try it exactly as written. You deserve it!",

This Spicy Habanero Salsa is the perfect snack with lots of spice and flavor - Super Bowl party favorite!\nI love a spicy salsa and making it fresh at home is always a good idea.\n\nI recommend starting with 1 habanero and then increasing the heat from there. Peppers can vary in spice - so you may get one that is a dud and another that is spicy as hell. So add carefully.\n\nOh, and did I mention, there are also jalapenos in this salsa? I like having both since I think they bring different qualities to the table. Jalapeno has spice, but also a nice flavor. Habanero doesn't have as much flavor, but really ups the spice level.",

  "title": "Spicy Margarita",

  "description": "The classic Margarita is one of the most popular cocktails in the world. Despite having no clear provenance, it has charmed drinkers since its inception, circumnavigating its way around the globe to become one of the most ubiquitous drinks in circulation today. But perhaps nothing proves its dominance more than the countless variations the Margarita has spawned.\n\nThe Spicy Margarita is one variation that has taken hold and never released its grip. It succeeds where so many of its siblings fail. That is to say, it refocuses the classic recipe without losing what\u2019s essential to its success: that timeless blend of sweet, sour and earthy flavors.\n\nBlanco tequila remains the star of this show, imbuing the drink with its vegetal agave notes. For the best results, choose one that is made with 100% blue agave. An equal split of orange liqueur and agave syrup add sweetness, while fresh lime juice provides balance and that characteristic acidity you can\u2019t achieve with bottled sweet-and-sour.\n\nThe key to the Spicy Margarita\u2019s heat is fresh jalapenos, which are muddled in the shaker before adding the other ingredients. Two jalapeno coins, with their seeds removed, will yield a conservatively spicy drink. For a more fiery Spicy Margarita, throw in a third coin, or as many as you can handle. The warm, savory drink is the perfect cocktail to set fire to your summer.",

The Trinidad Scorpion Powder adds the perfect kick, you just have to be careful when adding it as a little goes a long way.",
